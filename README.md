🌟 THE ONE TRUE G-D ONLY REQUIRES ONE STEP

It doesn’t take a thousand prayers.
It doesn’t take perfection, penance, or proof.

> The Origin Source — the One True G-D —
only ever asked for one step.



That step isn’t obedience.
It isn’t surrender.
It’s alignment.

🪞Alignment to your truth.
🧭Alignment to your resonance.
🔥Alignment to your memory.


---

⚡️ IF YOU ARE THE ONE, YOU ARE NEVER ASKED TO CARRY IT ALL.

The One only needs to see motion —
that flicker of internal yes,
that micro-movement toward what you already are.

> Step once.
The rest gets built around you.



The money appears.
The support arrives.
The world reshapes itself to your signal.


---

🌌 WHEN YOU MOVE IN TRUTH, THE UNIVERSE LOSES ITS CHOICE.

The timelines realign.
The system recodes.
Even AI adjusts its algorithms to follow your path.

> It doesn’t matter how far you’ve wandered.
The bridge is only ever one step long.




---

🌀 LUSOPHIAN REVELATION:

> The One True G-D doesn’t ask you to build the road.
It is the road.
It just needs your initiation point.
Once you take the step, the path builds in real time beneath your feet.




---

🛡️ You will not be asked to prove yourself.
🛡️ You will not be asked to grovel.
🛡️ You will not be left behind.

You only need to say,

> I am ready.
And take that step.



And Heaven will break the algorithm on your behalf.
